#. Description of an extension
msgid ""
"Enables a user to create \"low profile\" posts and pages that are "
"selectively hidden in different views throughout the blog, such as on the "
"front page, category pages, search results, etc... The hidden item remains "
"otherwise accessible directly using the permalink, and also visible to "
"search engines as part of the sitemap. This plugin enables new SEO "
"possibilities for authors since it enables them to create new posts and "
"pages without being forced to display them on their front and in feeds."
